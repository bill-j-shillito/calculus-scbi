Relate familiar geometric ideas to their calculus counterparts.      Introduction goes here.    Things to include  Calculus lets you do all the stuff you used to do with simple shapes and do them with complex shapes.    Before calculus, you could find the slope of a line; using calculus, you can find the slope of a curve.    Before calculus, you could find the length of a line segment; using calculus, you can find the length of a curve.    Before calculus, you could find the area of a rectangle; using calculus, you can find the area under a curve.    Before calculus, you could find the average rate of change between two points; using calculus, you can find the instantaneous rate of change at a single point.    Before calculus, you could sum a finite number of terms in a sequence; using calculus, you can add infinitely many tiny pieces.    Example: Area of a circle by making thin pizza slices and rearranging them to make a parallelogram.     Consider the part of the parabola bounded between and .    Estimate the length of this curve by breaking it into two equal-width segments and estimating with straight lines.    Refine your estimate by breaking it into four equal-width segments.    Refine your estimate by breaking it into eight equal-width segments.    Conjecture the true length of the curve.      Consider a circle with a radius of . Inscribe an -sided polygon inside it. (The point of this activity is to inscribe AND circumscribe in a polygon, and let the number of sides go to infinity.)    "
