Relate familiar geometric ideas to their calculus counterparts.      Introduction goes here.    Things to include  Calculus lets you do all the stuff you used to do with simple shapes and do them with complex shapes.    Before calculus, you could find the slope of a line; using calculus, you can find the slope of a curve.    Before calculus, you could find the length of a line segment; using calculus, you can find the length of a curve.    Before calculus, you could find the area of a rectangle; using calculus, you can find the area under a curve.    Before calculus, you could find the average rate of change between two points; using calculus, you can find the instantaneous rate of change at a single point.    Before calculus, you could sum a finite number of terms in a sequence; using calculus, you can add infinitely many tiny pieces.    Example: Area of a circle by making thin pizza slices and rearranging them to make a parallelogram.     Consider the part of the parabola bounded between and .    Estimate the length of this curve by breaking it into two equal-width segments and estimating with straight lines.    Refine your estimate by breaking it into four equal-width segments.    Refine your estimate by breaking it into eight equal-width segments.    Conjecture the true length of the curve.      Consider a circle with a radius of . Inscribe an -sided polygon inside it. (The point of this activity is to inscribe AND circumscribe in a polygon, and let the number of sides go to infinity.)    "

In single-variable calculus, to find absolute extrema, we had to look at critical points and boundary points. In multivariable calculus, that boundary is now an entire shape, so we can’t just check a few points.    To check the boundary of a shape, we can often substitute the boundary curve equation into the thing we want to optimize in order to reduce the number of variables, and then use single-variable calculus.    We also may be able to parameterize the boundary curve to get things in terms of a single variable. This uses the Chain Rule.    At that point, we just check all the candidates and take the highest and lowest one.    So the big theme here is, reduce a higher dimensional problem to a lower dimensional problem.    "

If we use basis vectors, we recover partial derivatives by projection:     Since the directional derivative is a dot product, it's maximized when points the same direction as the gradient, minimized when it points in the opposite direction. This leads to the gradient ascent\/descent algorithm.    Furthermore, when the directional derivative is perpendicular to the gradient, it will be zero. This means that the gradient is perpendicular to the level curves of a surface.    Chain Rule can now be rewritten as:     Tangent plane can also be written in vector form: This much more closely resembles our linearization from Chapter 2.    Rearrange slightly: Again this looks like a dot product! We're saying that is parallel to .

If curl is positive, the field is rotating counterclockwise, while if negative, it’s rotating clockwise.    In the 3D case, the curl is a vector, which points along the direction of the right-hand rule, so that the field is flowing counterclockwise around that vector as an axis. The magnitude is the strength of rotation.   A vector field with zero curl is called irrotational.    In fluid dynamics, an ideal fluid is incompressible and irrotational.

Recall the basic square wave with amplitude and period : Every term in this series is a continuous function — it’s just a sinusoid — but the resulting function is discontinuous!    The Gibbs phenomenon is the overshooting and undershooting that occurs around the points of discontinuity for any finite sum. It never goes away even with more and more times, because the series is not uniformly convergent.    From Wikipedia: “It is impossible for a discontinuous function to have absolutely convergent Fourier coefficients, since the function would thus be the uniform limit of continuous functions and therefore be continuous, a contradiction.”    If you integrate and then differentiate the infinite series, you get points where the derivative is undefined.    Derivative of the square wave term by term goes nuts!!    Fourier’s series caused a lot of mathematicians to slam on the brakes and try to figure out what was really going on.

Heine-Borel theorem: A set is compact if and only if is closed and bounded.    A continuous function on a compact set is bounded.    Extreme value theorem: A continuous function on a compact set attains its supremum and infimum.    A sequence is monotone increasing if for all . Similarly, is monotone decreasing if for all .    Monotone convergence theorem: A monotone sequence converges if and only if it is bounded. Moreover, if is increasing, then , and if is decreasing, then     Bounded sets contain bounded sequences.

  "body": " CAPSTONE: Non-standard analysis    The hyperreal numbers, denoted , are a number system where the real numbers have been extended by infinite and infinitesimal elements.    The whole idea was to make Newton and (especially?) Leibniz’s ideas of infinitesimals rigorous.    It’s actually pretty easy to algebraically extend the real numbers by adding an infinitesimal element. The difficult comes in extending things like transcendental functions to work with these new numbers.    Developed by Abraham Robinson in the 1960s    Extension principle:   The real numbers form a subset of the hyperreal numbers, and the order relation for the real numbers is a subset of the order relation for the hyperreal numbers.    There is a hyperreal number that is greater than zero but less than every positive real number.    For every real function of one or more variables, there exists a corresponding hyperreal function of the same number of variables, called the natural extension of . For any , we have .       Transfer principle: Every real statement that holds for one or more particular real functions holds for the hyperreal natural extensions of those functions. Essentially, algebraic formulas are true in the real numbers if and only if they’re true in the hyperreal numbers.    Basic laws of arithmetic: if is infinitesimal, is limited (finite but not infinitesimal), and is infinite:    is infinitesimal     is infinite     is infinite     is infinitesimal     is infinitesimal     is infinite     may be infinite, infinitesimal, or limited       Define the following symbols:   Then we have the following:                The standard part of a hyperreal number , denoted , is the unique real number such that . This function is external.    Continuity: A function is continuous at if whenever is infinitesimal. (This is called microcontinuity.)    Uniform continuity: A function is uniformly continuous if whenever and is infinitesimal, .    Derivative: If is infinitesimal, then     Extended subsets: (hypernatural, hyperinteger, hyperrational)    Integral:     Construction:   Start with the collection of all sequences in     Define addition and multiplication pointwise    Constant sequences are associated with real numbers    Comparisons are based on individual comparisons on a “large” number of terms:   For any set , either is large or its complement is large.    No finite sets are large \/ all cofinite sets are large.    Large sets are closed under intersections.    Large sets are upward closed; that is, if is large and , then is large.   A specification of these “large” sets is called a nonprincipal ultrafilter on . A nonprincipal ultrafilter exists if you assume Zorn’s lemma, and it’s unique up to isomorphism if you assume the Continuum Hypothesis.
