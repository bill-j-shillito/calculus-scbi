      <p>
        Introduce second derivative <m>f''</m> and its relationship to concavity
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>f''(x)>0</m>, then <m>f</m> is concave up
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>f''(x)&lt;0</m>, then <m>f</m> is concave down
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        Second Derivative Test for optimization

    <li>
      <p>
        Get into the Leibniz notation <m>\DS{\dv[2]{y}{x}}</m> ...and maybe why it’s NOT very good! The proper notation really should be <m>\DS{\dv{x}(\dv{y}{x})}</m>.
        But the notation is still pretty standard and hence we should learn it.
