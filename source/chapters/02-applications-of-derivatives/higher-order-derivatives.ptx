        Introduce second derivative <m>f''</m> and its relationship to concavity

          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>f''(x)>0</m>, then <m>f</m> is concave up
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>f''(x)&lt;0</m>, then <m>f</m> is concave down

        Get into the Leibniz notation <m>\dv[2]{y}{x}</m> ...and maybe why it’s NOT very good! The proper notation really should be <m>\dv{x}(\dv{y}{x})</m>.
        But the notation nis still pretty standard and hence we should learn it.
