        Visualize complex numbers as vectors and inherit addition and scaling properties from them.
        But how can we geometrically multiply them? Neither the dot product nor the cross product seems to match...
        though it's strangely close! If <m>z=a+b\ii</m> and <m>w=c+d\ii</m>, then
        <me>
          zw=(a+b\ii)(c+d\ii)=(ac-bd)+(ad+bc)\ii
        </me>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        We can take any complex number <m>z=a+b\ii</m> and write it as:
        <me>
          z=r\cos\theta+\ii\sin\theta
        </me>
        Here, <m>r</m> is the modulus, denoted <m>|z|</m>, and <m>\theta</m> is the argument, denoted <m>\arg z</m>.
        <aside>
          <p>
            The principal argument is defined as
          <me>
            -\uppi\lt\Arg z\le\uppi
          </me>.
          There's nothing special about this, it's just convenient.
          Also <m>\arg 0</m> is undefined.
          </p>
        </aside>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        By Euler's formula we also have:
        <me>
          \ee^{\ii\theta}=\cos\theta+\ii\sin\theta
        </me>
        This gives us exponential form of a complex number:
        <aside>
          <p>
            Engineers also write
          <me>
            z=r\Cis\theta
          </me>.
          </p>
        </aside>
        <me>
          z=r\ee^{\ii\theta}
        </me>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Now we can multiply and divide <m>z=r\ee^{\ii\theta}</m> and <m>w=s\ee^{\ii\phi}</m> as follows:
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>zw \amp = rs\ee^{\ii(\theta+\phi)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{z}{w} \amp = \frac{r}{s}\ee^{\ii(\theta-\phi)}</mrow>
      </md>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Define the complex conjugate <m>\overline{z}=a-b\ii</m>.
        Then we have the following:
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\overline{z}w \amp = (a-b\ii)(c+d\ii)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = (ac+bd)+(ad-bc)\ii</mrow>
      </md>

      <p>
        This form <em>does</em> match the dot and cross product!
        <aside>
          Honestly I wish it were <m>z\overline{w}</m> instead.
          There's something going on with how we do complex inner products.
          But I need to find it.
        </aside>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Powers using De Moivre's formula:
        <me>
          (r\ee^{\ii\theta})^{n}=r^{n}\ee^{n\ii\theta}
        </me>
        This works with roots as well, but we'll get <m>n</m> roots evenly spaced apart along the unit circle.
        Also mention <m>\sqrt[n]{z}</m> as principal value of <m>z^{1/n}</m>.
