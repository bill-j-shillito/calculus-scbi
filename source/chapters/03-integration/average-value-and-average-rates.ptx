          View average value as the mean height of a function over a region.

      <li>
        <p>
          Relate average rates of change to accumulated change over an interval.

      <p>
        Review average conceptually in terms of redistribution (perhaps give <url href="https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/1oyp48a/the_fascinating_etymology_of_average/">Arabic origin of the word</url>?)

      <p>
        The average value of <m>f(x)</m> on the interval <m>[a,b]</m> is
        <me>
          \frac{\DS\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\dd{x}}{b-a}
        </me>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        If we think of <m>f'</m> as the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m>, then the average rate of change
        of <m>f</m> is
        <me>
          \frac{\DS\int_{a}^{b} f'(x)\dd{x}}{b-a}=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
        </me>
      </p>

          This is something I never liked about the traditional curriculum — there's rarely any indication of why the AROC is any kind of <sq>average</sq>. For example, Stewart never explains this.
