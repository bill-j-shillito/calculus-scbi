    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Interpret dimension as the number of values needed to describe a state.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Identify real-world contexts that naturally give rise to additional dimensions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Apply spatial intuition to conceptualize non-spatial dimensions such as time.

    <li>
      <p>
        Dimensions are just a measure of how many numbers you need to specify a state.

        Give multiple real-world examples

        Don't have to be spatial dimensions, but our spatial intuition can give us insight on how we can understand non-spatial variables (e.g.
        using a time axis)
