        Sequential definition of continuity in 2D: Let <m>U\subseteq\bb R^{2}</m> be a set, <m>F:U\to\bb R</m> be a function, and <m>(x,y)\in U</m> be a point.
        The function <m>F</m> is continuous at <m>(x,y)</m> if for every sequence <m>((x_{n},y_{n}))_{n=1}^{\infty}</m> of points in <m>U</m> such that <m>\limit{n\to\infty}x_{n}=x</m> and <m>\limit{n\to\infty}y_{n}=y</m>, we have
        <me>
          \limit{n\to\infty}F(x_{n},y_{n})=F(x,y)\text{.}

        <theorem>
          <title>Picard-Lindelöf theorem</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Let <m>I,J\subseteq\bb R</m> be compact intervals, let <m>I^{\circ}</m> and <m>J^{\circ}</m> be their interiors, and let <m>(x_{0},y_{0})\in I^{\circ}\times J^{\circ}</m>.
              Suppose <m>F:I\times J\to\bb R</m> is continuous and Lipschitz in the second variable, that is, there exists an <m>L\in\bb R</m> such that
              <me>
                \abs{F(x,y)-F(x,z)}\le L\abs{y-z}\qquad\text{for all }y,z\in J, x\in I\text{.}
              </me>
              Then there exists an <m>h>0</m> such that <m>[x_{0}-h,x_{0}+h]\subseteq I</m> and a unique differentiable function <m>f:[x_{0}-h,x_{0}+h]\to J\subseteq R</m> such that
              <me>
                f'(x)=F(x,f(x))\qquad\text{and}\qquad f(x_{0})=y_{0}\text{.}
              </me>
            </p>
          </statement>
        </theorem>
        In other words, initial value problems have unique solutions under suitable conditions.

      <p>
        Proof relies on the idea of Picard iteration, the FTC, and uniform convergence of a sequence of functions, as well as the uniform norm.
