    <title>Things to include</title>
    <p>
      Calculus lets you do all the stuff you used to do with simple shapes and do them with complex shapes.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Before calculus, you could find the slope of a line; using calculus, you can find the slope of a curve.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Before calculus, you could find the length of a line segment; using calculus, you can find the length of a curve.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Before calculus, you could find the area of a rectangle; using calculus, you can find the area under a curve.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Before calculus, you could find the average rate of change between two points; using calculus, you can find the instantaneous rate of change at a single point.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Before calculus, you could sum a finite number of terms in a sequence; using calculus, you can add infinitely many tiny pieces.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Example: Area of a circle by making thin <q>pizza slices</q> and rearranging them to make a parallelogram.

  <exercises>
    <exercise>
      <p>Consider the part of the parabola <m>y=x^2</m> bounded between <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=1</m>.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Estimate the length of this curve by breaking it into two equal-width segments and estimating with straight lines.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Refine your estimate by breaking it into four equal-width segments.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Refine your estimate by breaking it into eight equal-width segments.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Conjecture the true length of the curve.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </exercise>
    <exercise>
      <p>
        Consider a circle with a radius of <m>1</m>. Inscribe an <m>n</m>-sided polygon inside it. (The point of this activity is to inscribe AND circumscribe in a polygon, and let the number of sides go to infinity.)
