      Introduction goes here.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        An open cover of <m>A</m> is a collection <m>\set{U_\alpha}_{\alpha\subseteq S}</m> such that
        <me>
          A\subseteq\bigcup_{\alpha\in S}U_{\alpha}\text{.}
        </me>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        If <m>\set{U_\alpha}_{\alpha\subseteq S}</m> has a finite subset <m>\set{U_\alpha}_{\alpha\subseteq F}</m> (with <m>F\subseteq S</m>) which is still a cover of <m>A</m>, then <m>\set{U_\alpha}_{\alpha\subseteq F}</m> is called a finite subcover of <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        A set <m>A</m> is compact if every open cover of <m>A</m> admits a finite subcover of <m>A</m>.Great note I saw online: “A has B” suggests that B is part of the nature of A.
        For example, every Cauchy sequence (in <m>\bb R</m>) has a limit.
        “A admits B” suggests that it is possible to find B, but this existence is not inherent to A, and we may not be able to find B explicitly.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Heine-Borel theorem: A set <m>S\subseteq\bb R^{n}</m> is compact if and only if <m>S</m> is closed and bounded.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        A continuous function on a compact set is bounded.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Extreme value theorem: A continuous function on a compact set attains its supremum and infimum.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        A sequence <m>(a_{n})</m> is monotone increasing if <m>a_{n}\le a_{n+1}</m> for all <m>n</m>.
        Similarly, <m>(a_{n})</m> is monotone decreasing if <m>a_{n}\ge a_{n+1}</m> for all <m>n</m>.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Monotone convergence theorem: A monotone sequence converges if and only if it is bounded.
        Moreover, if <m>(a_{n})</m> is increasing, then <m>\limit{n\to\infty}a_{n}=\sup\set{a_n:n\in\bb N}</m>, and if <m>(a_{n})</m> is decreasing, then <m>\limit{n\to\infty}a_{n}~=\inf\set{a_n:n\in\bb N}</m>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Bounded sets contain bounded sequences.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        If <m>n_{1}&#x3C;n_{2}&#x3C;n_{3}&#x3C;\cdots</m>, then
        <me>
          a_{n_1},a_{n_2},a_{n_3},\cdots
        </me>
        is called a subsequence of <m>(a_{n})</m> and is denoted <m>(a_{n_k})</m>.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        A sequence converges to <m>a</m> if and only if every subsequence converges to <m>a</m>.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        If <m>(a_{n})</m> has two subsequences that converge to different limits, then <m>(a_{n})</m> diverges.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        If <m>(a_{n})</m> is monotone and has a subsequence converging to <m>a</m>, then <m>(a_{n})</m> also converges to <m>a</m>.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem: Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        A space is sequentially compact if every sequence has a convergent subsequence.
      </p>
