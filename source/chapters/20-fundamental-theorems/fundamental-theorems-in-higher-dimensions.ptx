        <title>Gauss's divergence theorem</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>E</m> be a simple solid region and let <m>\bv{S}</m> be the boundary surface of <m>E</m>, given with positive (outward) orientation.
            Let <m>\bv F</m> be a vector field whose component functions have continuous partial derivatives on an open region containing <m>E</m>.
            Then:
            <me>
              \iint_{\bv{S}}\bv{F}\cdot\dd{\bv{S}}=\iiint_{E}\Div\bv{F}\dd{V}

            Let <m>\bv{S}</m> be an oriented piecewise-smooth surface that is bounded by a simple, closed, piecewise-smooth boundary curve <m>C</m> with positive orientation.
            Let <m>\bv F</m> be a vector field whose component functions have continuous partial derivatives on an open region containing <m>\bv{S}</m>.
