      Introduction goes here.

      <p>
        A function is analytic on <m>D</m> if its power series converges to the function.
        Cauchy's integral theorems imply that a function is holmorphic if and only if it is analytic and thus we can use the terms interchangeably.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        If a function <m>f</m> is not holomorphic at <m>z=z_{0}</m>, we say <m>f</m> has a singularity at <m>z_{0}</m>.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        If <m>f</m> has a singularity at <m>z=z_{0}</m>, we can represent it with a Laurent series, in which we allow negative powers of <m>(z-z_{0})</m>:
        <me>
          f(z)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}a_{k}(z-z_{0})^{k}=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}a_{-k}(z-z_{0})^{-k}+\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}(z-z_{0})^{k}
        </me>
        The part with the negative powers is called the principal part and the part with the nonnegative powers is called the analytic part.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        If <m>f</m> is holomorphic within the annular domain <m>D</m> defined by <m>r&#x3C;|z-z_{0}|&#x3C;R</m>, then <m>f</m> has a valid Laurent series representation, with the coefficeints given by
        <me>
          a_{k}=\frac{1}{2\uppi\ii}\oint_{C}\frac{f(z)}{(z-z_{0})^{k+1}}\dd{z}
        </me>,
        where <m>C</m> is a simple closed curve that lies entirely within <m>D</m> and has <m>z_{0}</m> in its interior.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Annular domains don't have to be ring-shaped...
        they could be circles, complements of circles, or the entire complex plane.

        Manipulations of power series by writing things in terms of <m>z-z_{0}</m> for some given <m>z_{0}</m>

        Types of singularities:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If the principal part has no terms, the singularity is a removable singularity.
              In this case we can always redefine a single point and make it holomorphic.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If the principal part has <m>n>0</m> terms, the singularity is a pole of order <m>n</m>.
              A pole of order <m>1</m> is a simple pole.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If the principal part has infinitely many terms, the singularity is an essential singularity.
            </p>

              A function <m>f</m> that is holomorphic in some disk <m>|z-z_{0}|&#x3C;R</m> has a zero of order <m>n</m> if and only if <m>f</m> can be written
              <me>
                f(z)=(z-z_{0})^{n}\phi(z)
              </me>
              where <m>\phi</m> is holomorphic at <m>z=z_{0}</m> and <m>\phi(z_{0})\neq 0</m>.

              A function <m>f</m> that is holomorphic in a punctured disk <m>0&#x3C;|z-z_{0}|&#x3C;R</m> has a pole of order <m>n</m> if and only if <m>f</m> can be written
              <me>
                f(z)=\frac{\phi(z)}{(z-z_{0})^{n}}
              </me>
              where <m>\phi</m> is holomorphic at <m>z=z_{0}</m> and <m>\phi(z_{0})\neq 0</m>.

              If <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> are analytic at <m>z=z_{0}</m>, and <m>h</m> has a zero of order <m>n</m> at <m>z=z_{0}</m> and <m>g(z_{0})\neq 0</m>, then <m>f(z)=g(z)/h(z)</m> has a pole of order <m>n</m> at <m>z=z_{0}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

              A function is meromorphic if it is analytic except at some set of isolated poles.

        Would this be the right place to talk about limits at infinity?
