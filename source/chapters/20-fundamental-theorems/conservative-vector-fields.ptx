      <p>
        A vector field is called conservative if its line integral is path independent; that is, the choice of path does not change the value of the line integral.
        Under what conditions is a vector field conservative?

        <theorem>
          <title>Gradient thoerem</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Suppose <m>C</m> is a smooth curve parametrized by the vector function <m>\bv r(t)</m> with <m>a\le t\le b</m>, and let <m>f</m> be a differentiable function whose gradient <m>\nabla f</m> is continuous.
              Then
              <me>
                \int_{C}\nabla f\cdot\dd{\bv{r}}=f(\bv{r}(b))-f(\bv{r}(a))
              </me>
            </p>
          </statement>
        </theorem>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        If <m>\bv F</m> is a gradient field, it must be conservative.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        As for the converse, if <m>\bv F</m> is conservative and is continuous on an open connected region <m>D</m>, then <m>\bv F</m> is a gradient field on <m>D</m>.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        A vector field is conservative if and only if every closed path integral is zero.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        The fact that the curl of a gradient is zero gives another test for whether a field is conservative.
        Suppose <m>\bv{F}=(P,Q)</m> is defined on an open simply connected region <m>D</m> and has continuous first order partial derivatives.
      </p>

      <p>
        If <m>\DS\pdv{P}{y}=\DS\pdv{Q}{x}</m> throughout <m>D</m>, then <m>\bv{F}</m> is conservative.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Make sure to do an example using energy to show the conservation law actually happening!
