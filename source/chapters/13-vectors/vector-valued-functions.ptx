      <p>
        Call back to Chapter 6 with motion in the plane:
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>x \amp = f(t)</mrow>
        <mrow>y \amp = g(t)</mrow>
      </md>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        We also thought of this as a vector, packing these functions into a single object:
        <me>
          \big(f(t),g(t)\big)
        </me>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Now we consider the vector to be an object in its own right, and we give it a name:
        <me>
          \bv{r}(t)=\big(f(t),g(t)\big)
        </me>
        The boldface is used to denote that <m>\bv{r}</m> returns a vector.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Since the vector depends on <m>t</m>, this is a vector-valued function.
        Notice that now we have a single input and two outputs, the opposite of what was in the last chapter.

      <p>
        Visual + algebraic look at vector addition, scalar multiplication...
        we're extending our usual arithmetic operations to these new objects.

        Extend parametric equation to 3D space:

      <md>
        <mrow>x \amp = f(t)</mrow>
        <mrow>y \amp = g(t)</mrow>
        <mrow>z \amp = h(t)</mrow>
      </md>
    </li>
  </ul>
