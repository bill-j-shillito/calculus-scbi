        2D Velocity:
        <me>
          \bv{v}(t)=\dv{\bv{r}}{t}=\qty(f'(t),g'(t))
        </me>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        2D Acceleration:
        <me>
          \bv{a}(t)=\dv{\bv{v}}{t}=\qty(f''(t),g''(t))
        </me>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        We've started with 2D, but point out how the vector notation makes it work for any dimension

        Equation of a line in 3D:
        <me>
          \bv{r}(t)=\bv{r}_{0}+\bv{v}_{0}t=(x_{0}+v_{0x}t,y_{0}+v_{0y}t,z_{0}+v_{0z}t)
        </me>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Length / norm of a vector is related to distance and Pythagorean theorem:
        <me>
          \norm{(a,b,c)}=\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}}
        </me>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Arc length:
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>s \amp = \int_a^b \norm{\bv{r}'(t)}\dd{t} </mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \int_a^b \sqrt{\qty(\dv{r_x}{t})^{2}+\qty(\dv{r_y}{t})^{2}+\qty(\dv{r_z}{t})^{2}}\dd{t} </mrow>
      </md>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        If we define <m>s(t)=\int_{a}^{t}\norm{\bv{r}'(u)}\dd{u}</m>, then <m>s(t)</m> is a one-to-one increasing function so it has an inverse.
        Hence if we solve for <m>t</m> as a function of <m>s</m>, i.e.
        <m>t(s)</m>, then <m>\bar{\bv{r}}(s)=\bv{r}(t(s))</m> is parametrized by arc length.
        This is called the natural parametrization of the curve.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        If we parametrize by arc length, then <m>\norm{\bar{\bv{r}}'(s)}=1</m>.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Difficult to do in practice, but often useful for theoretical arguments, and can be turned back into parametrization by <m>t</m>.
