      Introduction goes here.

      <p>
        The Laplacian operator:
        <me>
          \nabla^{2} f = \nabla\cdot\nabla f = \pdv[2]{f}{x}+\pdv[2]{f}{y}+\pdv[2]{f}{z}
        </me>
        In other words, Laplace’s equation (from PDE) is just <m>\nabla^{2} f=0</m>.
        Real-valued functions that satisfy this requirement are called harmonic functions.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Laplacian for vector functions:
        <me>
          \nabla^{2} \bv F =\qty(\nabla^2 P,\nabla^2 Q,\nabla^2 R)
        </me>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        If <m>f=u+\ii v</m> is analytic, then <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are holomorphic, and we say that <m>v</m> is the harmonic conjugate of <m>u</m>.
        Furthermore, <m>-u</m> is the harmonic conjugate of <m>v</m>.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        The level curves of <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> will be orthogonal families, that is, the tangent lines at all points of intersection will always be perpendicular.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        If <m>\phi</m> is a scalar function and <m>\nabla\phi=\bv F</m>, we say that <m>\phi</m> is a potential function (or just a potential) of <m>\bv F</m>, and we call <m>\bv F</m> a gradient field.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        If <m>\phi</m> is harmonic, it has a harmonic conjugate <m>\psi</m>, and we say that
        <me>
          \bv{\Omega}(z)=\phi(x,y)+\ii\psi(x,y)
        </me>
        is the complex potential of <m>\bv F</m>.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        If <m>\bv F(x,y)=(u(x,y),v(x,y))</m> is the velocity field of an ideal fluid (that is, incompressible and irrotational), then <m>f(x,y)=u(x,y)-\ii v(x,y)</m> is holomorphic (it satisfies the Cauchy Riemann equations), and furthermore <m>\bv{\Omega}(z)</m> as defined above is its potential function, which is also holomorphic.
      </p>

      <p>
        We say that <m>\bv F</m> is the Pólya vector field of the complex function <m>f</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Notice that this shows a connection between the equations for curl and divergence and the Cauchy-Riemann equations, but they’re each off by a minus sign.
        The reason for this sign change will become clear when we do contour integrals later.
