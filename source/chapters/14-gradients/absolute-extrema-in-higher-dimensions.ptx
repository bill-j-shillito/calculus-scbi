        In single-variable calculus, to find absolute extrema, we had to look at critical points and boundary points.
        In multivariable calculus, that boundary is now an entire shape, so we can’t just check a few points.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        To check the boundary of a shape, we can often substitute the boundary curve equation into the thing we want to optimize in order to reduce the number of variables, and then use single-variable calculus.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        We also may be able to parameterize the boundary curve to get things in terms of a single variable.
        This uses the Chain Rule.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        At that point, we just check all the candidates and take the highest and lowest one.
      </p>
    </li>

        So the big theme here is, reduce a higher dimensional problem to a lower dimensional problem.
