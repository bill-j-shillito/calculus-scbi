        If the demand curve <m>p=D(q)</m> and the supply curve <m>p=S(q)</m> meet at the equilibrium point <m>(\bar{q},\bar{p})</m>, then the consumer surplus is
        <me>
          CS=\int_{0}^{\bar{q}}(D(q)-\bar p)\dd{q}
        </me>,
        and the producer surplus is
        <me>
          PS=\int_{0}^{\bar{q}}(\bar p-S(q))\dd{q}
        </me>.

        A Lorenz curve is a function <m>L(x)</m>, where <m>0\le x\le 1</m>, that describes how wealth is distributed among the members of a population.
        Given any Lorenz curve <m>L</m>, the Gini coefficient is defined as
        <me>
          =\frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{1}(x-L(x))\dd{x}
        </me>.
        This can be used as a quantitative measure of income inequality.
