        <p>
          Compute volume by adding the contributions of thin cylindrical shells.

      <li>
        <p>
          Use shell height and radius to quantify each shell's contribution.

      <li>
        <p>
          Choose shells or washers based on which method aligns with the region's geometry.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Start with an example that can't be done with washers because of non-invertible functions.

        If the region under the curve <m>y=f(x)</m> from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> (<m>0\le a \lt  b</m>) is revolved around the <m>x</m>-axis, the volume is
        <me>
          V=\int_{a}^{b} 2\uppi xf(x)\dd{x}
        </me>
      </p>

    <li>

        Include something about how to know which method may be best.
