      Introduction goes here.

    <li>
      <p>
        Since <m>\ln x</m> and <m>\ee^{x}</m> are inverses, we can evaluate <m>\DS\dv{x} \ee^{\ln x}</m> two ways to find that <m>\DS\dv{x}\ln x=\frac{1}{x}</m>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        In general, derivatives of inverse functions:
        <me>
          \dv{x} f\inv(x)=\dfrac1{f'(f\inv(x))}
        </me>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        For any base <m>b</m>, we can use the fact that <m>\ee^{\ln b}=b</m> and the Chain Rule to get
        <me>
          \dv{x} b^{x}=\dv{x}(\ee^{\ln b})^{x}=\dv{x}(\ee^{x})^{\ln b}=\ln(b)(\ee^{x})^{\ln(b)-1}\cdot \ee^{x}=b^{x}\ln b
        </me>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        We can also rewrite <m>x^{a}</m> for any real <m>a</m> as <m>e^{a \ln x}</m> to show that the Power Rule works for any real exponent.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Logarithmic differentiation:
        <me>
          \dv{x}\ln y=\frac{y'}{y}
        </me>
        Good for complicated derivatives or derivatives involving <m>x</m> in both base and power.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        Elasticity of a function:
        <aside>
          <p>
            The elasticity of a power function is its degree, and in the limit, the elasticity of a polynomial is its degree.
            This can in some sense be used to define the degree of non-power functions.
          </p>
        </aside>
        <me>
          E=\dv{(\ln y)}{(\ln x)}=\frac{x}{y}\dv{y}{x}=\frac{\dd{y}/\dd{x}}{y/x}
        </me>
        This is a relative rate of change, which is useful in economics (e.g.
        price elasticity of demand).
        Maybe use this as the guiding application?
