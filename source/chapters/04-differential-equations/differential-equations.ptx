        A differential equation is an equation that gives information about the derivative(s) of a function, and you need to find the original function that fits that description.

        Use motion example from physics to start with <m>s''(t)=a</m> and end up with <m>s(t)=s_{0}+v_{0}t+\tfrac12at^{2}</m>
