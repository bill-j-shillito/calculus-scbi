      <p>
        A geometric sequence is a sequence in which the terms are in a constant common ratio from one to the next.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        A geometric series is the infinite sum.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sum of a geometric series: shift and subtract
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        Graph the function...
        it only converges when <m>-1\lt x\lt 1</m>.
        Verify that this makes sense with the numerical behavior.
        Takeaway: we have to watch out for where any given power series converges.
