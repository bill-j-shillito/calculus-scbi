        For a surface to be oriented it has to have two sides.
        We take the tangent plane at each point and notice there are two unit normal vectors <m>\uv n</m> and <m>-\uv n</m>.
        As we move around the surface, these two normal vary smoothly.
        The surface is oriented if it is impossible to move around the surface following <m>\uv n</m> and end up with it overlapping <m>-\uv n</m>.
        Alternatively, we can make sure that a counterclockwise loop can’t be moved around the surface and end up with it going clockwise.

        An example of a non-orientable surface is a Möbius strip.

        If <m>\bv{\cal{S}}</m> is an oriented surface, then the surface integral of <m>\bv F</m> over <m>\bv{\cal{S}}</m> is
        <me>
          \iint_{\bv{\cal{S}}}\bv F\cdot\dd{\bv{\cal{S}}}=\iint_{D} \bv F\cdot\qty(\pdv{\bv{r}}{u}\times\pdv{\bv{r}}{v})\dd{A}
        </me>.
        This can also be written as
        <me>
          \iint_{D} \qty(\bv F\cdot\frac{\bv r'_{u}\times\bv r'_{v}}{\norm{\bv r'_u\times\bv r'_v}}\norm{\bv r'_u\times\bv r'_v})\dd{A}=\iint_{\cl S}\bv F\cdot\uv n\,\dd{\bv{\cal{S}}}
        </me>.
        That is, this surface integral represents the flux of <m>\cl F</m> through the surface.

        For closed surfaces, positive orientation means the normals point out of the surface.
