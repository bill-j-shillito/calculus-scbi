      Rolle's theorem Let <m>f:[a,b]\to\bb R</m> be continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>.
      If <m>f(a)=f(b)</m>, then there exists <m>c\in(a,b)</m> where <m>f'(c)=0</m>.
      (This can be used to prove the MVT.)

            If a function has zero derivative on an interval, it must be constant.

            If two functions have the same derivative on an interval, they must differ by a constant.

            A function is monotone increasing if and only if its derivative is nonnegative on an interval.

      Cauchy's mean value theorem: If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>, then there is a number <m>c\in (a,b)</m> such that
      <me>
        [f(b)-f(a)]\cdot g'(c)=[g(b)-g(a)]\cdot f'(c)\text{.}
      </me>
      Another way to visualize it is to have a parametric curve <m>(f(t),g(t))</m> for <m>a\le t\le b</m> and point out that there exists <m>c\in(a,b)</m> such that
      <me>
        \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}=\dfrac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}
      </me>
      (assuming that the denominators aren't zero).
